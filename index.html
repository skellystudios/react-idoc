      The Temporary City
    </h1>

    <p class="fade-text fade-in fade-delay1">
      In the past decade cities like London have been transformed by the rapid rise of ‘pop-up’ culture; a fashion for temporary and mobile places.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-text fade-in fade-delay2">
      Pop-ups have become so prevalent that many are proclaiming the birth of ‘the temporary city’: a new mode of imagining and producing the urban fabric. This is a vision in which the city surface shifts daily as mobile cinemas, temporary bars, immersive theatres or shipping container shops navigate its nooks and niches, popping-up unexpectedly.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-text fade-in fade-delay3">
     This interactive film explores three types of pop-up geography: pop-up cinemas, shipping container architectures and supper clubs.
