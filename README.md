## Running

You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed on your computer.
From the root project directory run these commands from the command line:

    npm install

This will install all dependencies.

To build the project, first run this command:

    npm start

This will perform an initial build and start a watcher process that will update bundle.js with any changes you wish to make.  This watcher is based on [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [Watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify), and it transforms React's JSX syntax into standard JavaScript with [Reactify](https://github.com/andreypopp/reactify).


## To Do

- [x] Add a front page
- [ ] Support zooming into the future from a "next item"
- [ ] End state
- [ ] Reset time / clip select option



- [ ] think the whole thing is meant to be behind a password for ethics reasons – is that possible or really annoying?
- [x] Obvs the icons need fixing
- [x] on the opening page can “this interactive film” be replaced with “this interactive documentary”
- [x] on the opening page can we cut the last bit of the text from where it says “in order to unpick...”
- [x] can I change the text in the supper club category section to say
“At supper clubs paying guests are invited into the homes of strangers to be wined, dined and entertained. Here, domestic spaces become part of pop-up’s secret geographies.”
- [x] Can I change the text in the container category section to say
“If the invention of shipping containers transformed the world economy in the second half of the 20th century then it seems we are now entering containerization stage 2. “Cargotectures”, as they have been termed, are flexible, modular architectural structures that are now prevalent across London and seemingly popular with hipsters!”
- [x] Can I change the text in the reel city category view to say
“If cinema has long reformulated visions of the city, and vice-versa, pop-up screenings bring ‘the reel’ and ‘the real’ into contact in new ways, transforming city spaces into versions of film worlds, giving spectators embodied encounters with film fictions and taking visitors on cinematic journeys along London’s waterways.”
- [x] The link to ‘see what’s happening outside temporary city’ at the end of the barber shop clip currently goes to a generic image of containers – can we make it the outside pop-up city page of containers please?
- [ ] by the end of the paradise yard clip there seems to be no other clips left on the map  – think the clip lasts over a year? does time need slowing down?
- [ ] the outside pop up city page link at the end of paradise yard doesn’t work


## Future work?


- [ ] Different colours for different paths
- [ ] Different markers for different streams
- [ ] Do the clock thing correctly to avoid February 30th
- [ ] Set up the "next item" nicely
