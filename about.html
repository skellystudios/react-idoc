      <h3>About this iDoc</h3>
      <p>
      	This interactive documentary was made as a methodological experiment. It forms part of the thinking I undertook towards my PhD thesis entitled “Re-Imagining Space-Time in the Temporary City”. The thesis explores ways in which space-time is imagined and (re)produced by pop-up culture in contemporary London and interrogates the politics of those imaginaries. For me, the ‘nonlinear’ architecture of interactive documentary makes it a great medium through which to think about pop-up’s own ‘nonlinear’ imaginations of space-time as immersive, flexible, interstitial, secret and surprising.

      <h3>Making of the iDoc</h3>
      <p> The footage and images in this i-Doc were shot and edited by myself as part of my PhD research. The
‘architecture’ of the i-Doc was designed and developed alongside my written thinking as a way to
understand and communicate pop-up space-time. The creation of the interface was made possible
by Michael Skelly who coded the i-Doc from scratch and helped me to turn my take on the
temporary city into a ‘playable’ experience.</p>
