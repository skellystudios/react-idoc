      <h3>About this iDoc</h3>
      <p>
      Follow the pop-up city for a year.
      <br><br>
      Experience pop-ups as they come and go by clicking on the icons of containers, supper clubs and cinemas (film reels). You can also move forward by following the suggested links at the ends of clips to continue with a common theme or aesthetic. 
      <br><br>
      Don’t expect to catch all the pop-ups first go, some are bound to elude you!
